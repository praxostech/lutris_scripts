    # I chose to unpack the setup instead of running it because it guarantess, that the game is installed in the correct directory.
    # When using the wineexec task I was running into errors if I tried to use longer path names.
    # So my solution was to unpack the files in a subdirectory of C:\; it is not the best solution, but it works.
    # Maybe I will optimize the script in the future, if I do have the time and a good reason to do so.
