notes: "* Running the game in fullscreen will result in a visual bug where the game will cover one quarter of the screen.\n   Alt-Tabing 1-3 times to another program and back to game will make the game displaying properly.\n   Running the game in windowed mode will work just fine.\n* Please change your wine version to the newest release of 'wine-ge' or 'Lutris-GE-Proton' after the installation, if it is not already set. The game will not work in fullscreen with the standard 'lutris-wine'-version."
